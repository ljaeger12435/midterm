    <p>Architecture shapes our daily lives—the spaces that envelop us, the materials that surround us—determining whether we feel secure and at ease, whether we choose to linger or depart. The design processes in architecture are deeply intertwined with questions of social impact: How do we create environments where people feel so at home in public spaces that they can meet as equals, cultivating a private sense of community within the public realm? How do we ensure that public luxury is accessible to everyone, without exclusion?</p>
    <p>Therefore construction industry must radically break away from today’s standards.</p>  
    <p> Architects and their supposed purpose of building are a big part of the problem, not only in social contexts but - because everything is connected - also in ecological matters: contributing to the 38 percent of global CO2 emissions and generating an estimated third of the world’s overall waste there is significant potential for improvement through change.</p>
    <p>While some interpret economic indicators—such as greater investment volume, rising salaries, and increasing construction sums—as an opportunity to profit from omnipresent growth through hard work, others view them as symptoms of a multiple crisis.</p> 
    <p>This impact is magnified by corrupt and exploitative systems, such as the sand mafia or the deforestation of rainforests to supply cheap materials like cement, glass, and wood. These practices not only devastate nature but also exploit humanity, forcing both into unsustainable cycles of destruction. It is only a matter of time before this system collapses under the weight of its own exploitation.</p>  
    <p>We strive to enable progressive change, ensuring that placemakers and designers truly reflect the communities they serve. This means fostering co-determination, encouraging co-creation, and embracing empowerment—nurturing spaces where self-realization and democratic design are not lofty ideals but lived realities.</p> 
    <p>This brings us back to the essential questions: How can we create truly inclusive and sustainable practices, starting from the value chain and extending to the use, reuse, or recycling of resources? How can we ensure that architecture becomes a tool for positive transformation rather than perpetuating destructive systems? How do we make design processes that reflect and serve the needs of the communities they impact? The answers lie in rethinking the very foundations of how and why we build.</p>
