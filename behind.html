    <p> Lotta Jaeger, born 1998 in the south of Germany, is currently a bachelor student of architecture at the Berliner Hochschule fuer Technik.</p>
        <p>After finishing middle school, she started an apprenticeship as a taylor in Irsee, sewing traditional dresses with a focus on handcrafting techniques.</p>
            <p>As soon as she finished her apprenticeship, she entered the fashion industry. Working in the fashion industry gave her insight into the immense inequalities in wealth distribution. She observed how it is always the wealthy who benefit from precarious labor, growing richer at the expense of others.</p>
                <p>Seeing those inequalities, she developed the desire to contribute to society. So after working in the industry for two years full-time, Lotta decided to pursue her Abitur (high school diploma) to enable her to study at university. Seeing Architecture as the perfect intersection of art, culture, politics, and technology, she chose it as her field of study, recognizing that her knowledge of fabrics and materials could be a valuable asset in architectural design.</p>
                    
                <p>This portfolio was created as part of a university project with the support of F. Ecem ERGİN, Ph.D., Assistant Professor at the Faculty of Architecture.</p>
